# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to Actua are recorded here. This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) where practical. Versions marked `alpha` are testing builds and may contain incomplete workflows or require a clean reinstall before a future production release.

## Unreleased

## [0.1.0-alpha.4] - 2026-09-07

Fourth public testing release.

### Added

- Full-screen Material account, payee, and category selectors with immediate search, alphabetical sections, selected-item indicators, transfer-account grouping, new-payee creation, and account balances
- A persistent availability-focused Plan budget view alongside the existing table view
- Interactive Plan figures: Assigned opens assignment and money-moving actions, while Spent opens the category's transactions for the selected month
- Ready to Assign and To Budget funding flows for assigning money to categories or covering a negative To Budget balance
- Source of Fund/Income as the final Budget section, with Actual-backed received totals and income-safe actions

### Changed

- Adopted the original Actua Fold A as a fully scalable SVG and native Android vector icon
- Preserved the solid violet adaptive background with matching Android 13+ Material You vector geometry
- Aligned account working-balance values by moving the disclosure control beside the label
- Remembered collapsed account summaries and Budget category groups across navigation and app restarts
- Replaced always-open account and category note forms with compact tappable note rows and focused editors
- Added a tappable Budget month label with a Material month-and-year selector
- Ported Actuali's rule manager with searchable summaries, stage ordering, all/any conditions, typed values, entity pickers, and editable actions
- Added Actual-compatible CRDT rule creation, updates, deletion, schedule-owned rule protection, and native transaction execution
- Added editable primary and fallback Actual server URLs without disconnecting or replacing downloaded budgets, with automatic failover during connection and sync
- Allowed cleartext HTTP for the configured local Actual server at `192.168.68.109` while retaining Android's cleartext block for other destinations
- Renamed the independent Android client from Actuali for Android to Actua
- Changed the application ID and Kotlin namespace from `com.azimulkabir.actuali`
  to `com.azimulkabir.actua`
- Added an original Material You-ready adaptive launcher icon with a monochrome
  themed-icon layer
- Updated project documentation while preserving credit to Actuali for iOS and
  Actual Budget
- Transaction notes now use a compact single-line field
- Budget groups, categories, account sections, and account rows have clearer Material hierarchy
- Availability pills in Plan view use tighter corners and aligned amount text
- Saving or cancelling an edited transaction returns to its originating account

### Migration

- Android treats Actua as a separate app from earlier Actuali for Android alpha
  builds. Synchronize and back up local changes before removing an older build.

## [0.1.0-alpha.3] - 2026-09-06

Third public testing release.

### Changed

- The working-balance summary in account details can now be collapsed while keeping the current balance visible
- Account balance details and notes now use the same compact typography scale as the Budget tab
- Added restrained Material motion for main-tab changes, detail navigation, search fields, and expandable account summaries

## [0.1.0-alpha.2] - 2026-09-05

Second public testing release.

### Added

- Account details now show working, cleared, uncleared, and reconciled balances
- Synced notes for accounts and budget categories using Actual's native notes data
- Credit-card account details with available credit, limit, current billing cycle, cycle spend, and payment due date
- Category rollover-overspending control and history-based quick assign suggestions
- Full split transaction entry and editing with per-line category, amount, optional payee, note, direction, remaining amount, line addition/removal, and collapse back to a normal transaction

### Fixed

- Transaction forms now scroll through fields and actions within the available screen and keyboard space
- Expense, Income, and Transfer selector labels are centered consistently
- Add mode now has an explicit Cancel action; Edit mode has working Save, Delete, and Cancel actions
- Split edits retain existing child transaction identities instead of unnecessarily replacing every line
- Existing split transactions can be safely converted back to standard transactions

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- Optional symbol-only currency formatting

### Known limitations

- This build is alpha software and should be used with tested backups
- The APK is debug-signed for sideload testing, not Play Store distribution
- OpenID Connect, custom proxy headers, advanced dashboards, bank-feed setup, and schedule-management UI are not yet included
- Some advanced entity merge, reorder, template, goal, and automation workflows remain incomplete
- Apple-only features from the iOS project are intentionally excluded
