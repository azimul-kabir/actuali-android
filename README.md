# Actua

**A native Android client for [Actual Budget](https://actualbudget.org/), built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.**

</div>

## About this project

Actua is an independent, community-maintained Android project. Its development
was originally based on and informed by [Matt Farrell's open-source Actuali
project for iOS](https://github.com/MattFaz/actuali), whose tested behavior and
implementation remain important references.

Actua connects directly to a self-hosted Actual server. Budgets are downloaded
to local SQLite storage, remain usable offline, and synchronize through Actual's
encrypted CRDT protocol. There is no intermediary account or service operated
by this app.

Actua is not an official release of, affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported
by either the Actuali project or the Actual Budget team.

## Current functionality

- Password connection to an Actual server and budget download/selection
- Offline local budget storage and encrypted CRDT synchronization
- Automatic, foreground, post-mutation, and manual sync
- Budget table and availability-focused Plan views, category groups, Source of Fund/Income, monthly amounts, progress bars, and hide/show management
- Account lists, working/cleared/uncleared/reconciled balances, notes, monthly summaries, and full transaction history
- Expense, income, transfer, editable split, edit, clear, and delete transaction flows
- Full-screen searchable account, payee, and category selection with account balances, transfer grouping, and new-payee creation
- Ready to Assign/To Budget assignment plus category-to-category and category-to-budget money movement
- Calculator-style and conventional amount entry
- Account, category, and group creation plus working contextual actions
- Local backup, restore, retention, and pre-restore revert
- Actual-compatible rules management, editing, CRDT sync, and transaction processing
- Category notes, rollover overspending, and history-based quick assign
- Credit-card limits, billing-cycle metadata, due dates, and cycle spending stored through Actual preferences
- Reports, display currency, decimal, appearance, start-page, and privacy preferences
- Global search across transactions, accounts, payees, categories, notes, and transfers
- Unified Material You category budgeting with auto-assign, money movement, details, and recent activity
- Material You motion for tab changes, detail navigation, searches, and expandable sections

See [BACKEND_PARITY.md](BACKEND_PARITY.md) for the implementation boundary and detailed port status.

## Scope

The goal is behavioral compatibility with Actual Budget and with portable
budgeting behavior proven by Actuali, while retaining a native Android UI built
with Jetpack Compose. Changes in the iOS project can be reviewed and ported over
time, but this is a source-level reimplementation—not shared Swift code or a
byte-for-byte conversion.

Apple-platform integrations are deliberately excluded, including FinanceKit, Apple Wallet, Siri, App Intents, Shortcuts, iCloud, Keychain, and Apple background-task APIs. Android equivalents are used only where they serve the core budgeting workflow, such as Android Keystore and WorkManager.

## Requirements

- Android 9 (API 28) or later
- A reachable self-hosted Actual Budget server
- Android Studio with JDK 11 or later for local builds

## Testing releases

Testing APKs are published on the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/azimul-kabir/actuali-android/releases). Download the APK on an Android device, allow installation from the browser or file manager when prompted, and open Actua.

Actua uses the application ID `com.azimulkabir.actua`. Android therefore treats
it as a separate app from the earlier Actuali for Android alpha builds. Confirm
that local changes are synchronized and backed up before removing an older build.

Initial alpha builds are debug-signed and intended only for trusted testers. Android updates require matching signing keys, so a later production-signed build may require uninstalling the alpha build first. Back up local data before replacing or uninstalling any test build.

## Build and test

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
./gradlew testInstrumentedUnitTest lintDebug
./gradlew installDebug
```

The app can then connect from **More → Connection & Data**. Use the complete server URL and password, choose a remote budget, and download it to the device.

## Architecture

```

Writes are applied locally and represented as Actual-compatible CRDT messages. WorkManager provides Android-native periodic synchronization and backup scheduling.

## Upstream relationship and credits

Actua began as an Android reimplementation based on **[Matt Farrell's Actuali
for iOS](https://github.com/MattFaz/actuali)**. Its product design, tested
behavior, Swift implementation, documentation, and sync work continue to guide
portable behavior. Please use the original repository for the iPhone and iPad
app and direct iOS-specific contributions and issues there. Copyright attribution
from the upstream repository is preserved in this project's license.

Actuali itself builds on **[Actual Budget](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual)**. Portions of the synchronization behavior derive from Actual Budget's MIT-licensed CRDT and loot-core implementations, originally copyrighted by James Long and subsequent contributors.

The original Actuali icon was designed by
**[u/bdownz](https://www.reddit.com/user/bdownz/)**. Actua uses a new,
independently created adaptive icon and does not reuse that artwork.

Android bug reports and port-specific contributions belong in this repository. When implementing parity behavior, link the relevant upstream Actuali source, test, issue, or commit where possible. Do not report Android-port problems in the original iOS repository unless the same issue is reproducible in the iOS app.
